# Sample Form Application
This application demonstrates a simple Angular front-end with a .NET Core backend for handling form submissions. The front-end form allows users to enter a name and address, with basic validation for each field. Upon successful submission, the entered data is displayed in the console, and a success alert is shown.

## Features
- **Angular 15 Front-end** with form validation for `name` and `address` fields
- **.NET Core 6 Back-end** with a simple RESTful API for receiving form data
- Uses **Dependency Injection**, **Domain-Driven Design** (DDD), and **SOLID principles**
- Includes **Reset** button to clear the form and validation states

## Requirements
- **Angular 15**
- **.NET Core 6**
- **Node.js** (for Angular setup)
- **Visual Studio** (latest version recommended for .NET backend)
